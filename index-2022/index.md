date: 2019-11-17

**NYC Secular Solstice this year will be on December the 21st, Saturday Night, in  the Ida Long auditorium at Hunter College. That weekend, from Friday December 20th to Monday December 23rd, we'll be hosting weekend long rationalist community get-together with accommodations for those who are visiting. If you'd like to join us, please register below!

For nearly a decade, a secular solstice has been held in New York, greeting the longest night with song and community. For two years, the East Coast Rationalist Megameetup has been organized by Taymon and Michael in NYC to extend that sense of community for the whole weekend. Well, once is a good idea, twice is a successful replication, and the third time is a habit.

If you need a place to stay, we're renting a big house together. We're pricing the sleeping arrangements at $110 per person, and the other costs (for the activities listed below) at $25 per person, for a total cost of $135. 

If you already have accommodations andwould like to join in the events and festivities but not sleep over, please register as well! Again, the megameetup-only cost is $25 per person, much of which is for food.

Registration for the megameetup does not include solstice tickets, so make sure to get those separately.

The exact schedule for the weekend is up in the air, but we're planning on hosting:

 - three meals: Saturday lunch, Saturday dinner, and Sunday breakfast
 - Secular Solstice afterparty on Saturday night
 - an unconference on Sunday

Of course, that leaves plenty of time for other activities, as well as general social mixing. 

If you'd like to attend, please register as soon as possible so we can get an accurate headcount and book an ideal space for the event. We’re aiming to rent the same place as last year, which is a 9 bedroom house that we’ll put air mattresses around for extra places. Peak occupancy is likely to be a little crowded as usual, but non-peak occupancy should be more spacious. Saturday night is expected to be the busiest, but the house has several floors so hopefully as people wind down rooms will free up. 

*Anyone who would like to attend but cannot afford $135 should contact me directly for arrangements.*
