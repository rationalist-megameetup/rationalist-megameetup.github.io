title: East Coast Rationalist Megameetup 2017
date: 2017-10-20

**TL;DR: We’re putting together a weekend-long gathering of rationalist community people in NYC for Solstice weekend. If you want in, register below.**

As you might already know, the seventh annual Secular Solstice celebration is happening this year in New York City on December 9. This means we’ll have a whole bunch of people from the rationalist community all in town for the same weekend.

Since many of us need a place to stay anyway, we’re renting a big house together in Astoria, Queens, and using that as the central gathering place, like at Highgarden in 2014. This way we’ll get to spend the weekend hanging out together, with more flexibility to do things than if we all had to wander around looking for a public space.

Besides Solstice and the afterparty, the big activity will be an unconference on Sunday. We’ll also have a ritual lab, games, meals together, and whatever other activities you want to run! There'll also be plenty of room for unstructured socializing, of course.

**Registration for sleeping over is now closed.** The house is at capacity. Thanks to everyone who registered! Contact the organizer if you’d like to be put on the waitlist.

Registration is still open if you just want to hang out with us during the day. It costs $25 per person, primarily to cover food (at least three meals throughout the weekend). Solstice tickets are also not included; if you don’t already have one from the Kickstarter, you can get one on Eventbrite.

If you want to read the original master plan, it’s here. Please be aware that some details are now out of date.

Please don’t hesitate to contact the organizer if you have any questions, if the price is an issue for you, or if you want to make any other kind of individual arrangement.

*Special thanks to everyone who preregistered and helped make this event possible!*
