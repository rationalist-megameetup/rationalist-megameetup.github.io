title: East Coast Rationalist Megameetup 2018
date: 2018-10-26

**NYC Secular Solstice this year will be on December 15. That weekend, from December 14 to 17, we'll be hosting a rationalist community gathering with accommodations for out-of-towners in the NYC area. If you'd like to join us, please register below!**

The stars are aligning for the solstice season to be soon upon us! The eighth annual Secular Solstice in NYC will be held on December 15. Every year, rationalist sojourners travel to New York to gather together and experience the darkest time of the year in the light of our community. Last year, Taymon organized the first East Coast Rationalist Megameetup here in NYC, and it was a great success. This year we are again organizing a gathering place that weekend for solstice sojourners and New Yorkers alike, to solidify that tradition into our second annual East Coast Rationalist Megameetup.

For those traveling from out of town, we're renting a big house together! Like last year, we're pricing the sleeping arrangements at $100 per person, and the other costs (for the activities listed below) at $25 per person, for a total cost of $125.

For New Yorkers or those who already have accommodations, who would like to join in the events and festivities but not sleep over, please register as well! Again, the megameetup-only cost is $25 per person.

The exact schedule for the weekend is up in the air, but we're planning on hosting:
 - three meals: Saturday lunch, Saturday dinner, and Sunday breakfast
 - Secular Solstice afterparty on Saturday night
 - an unconference on Sunday

Depending on the attendees and interest, we're hoping to also plan some other activities to further the megameetup tradition.

If you'd like to attend, please register as soon as possible so we can get an accurate headcount and book an ideal space for the event. For reference, last year we rented a 9 bedroom house which we stretched (with air mattresses and creativity) to sleep XX at peak occupancy (Saturday night). This year we're shooting for two to a bed and one per air mattress at peak occupancy -- non-peak occupancy is expected to be significantly less crowded. Solstice tickets are not included in either of these registrations, so please make sure to register for Solstice separately.

*Anyone who would like to attend but cannot afford $125 should contact me directly for arrangements.*
